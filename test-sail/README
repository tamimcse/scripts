routes-*        --- Routing table of ISPs where next-hops are replaced with veth0-veth31
addroutes.sh      --- Add routes in routes.txt
delroutes.sh      --- Delete routes in routes.txt

These files are internally used by addroutes.sh and delroutes.sh:
 
create-veths.py   --- Create 32 veths on the machine
addroutes.py      --- Add routes in routes.1.txt
delroutes.py      --- Delete routes in routes.1.txt


Routes in routes-* are produced from the actual RIB snapshot of http://www.routeviews.org/routeviews/. Each RIB snapshots however contains routes from multiple backbone routers. Moreover the snapshot are in MRT format (not human headable). We extract the actual routing table from the RIB snopshot as following:

1. Use BGPdump (libbgpdump) to convert the MRT file into a human readable text file. BGPdump has several output mode. Here we use output mode -m.
2. Then we use bgpdump-parser.sh to convert the bgpdump output file into routes.txt. bgpdump-parser.sh internally use bgpdump-parser.py which performs the actual conversion.
